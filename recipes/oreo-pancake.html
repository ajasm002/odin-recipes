    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>15 Oreo chocolate sandwich cookies, finely crushed</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups whole milk 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (plus more for skillet)</li>
      <li>optional: extra crushed Oreos for topping and whip cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and crushed Oreos. Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the beaten eggs, milk, and 4 tablespoons of the melted butter.</li>
      <li>
        Add wet mixture to the dry mixture. Combine well, but donâ€™t overmix. Batter should still be slightly lumpy. If time permits, allow batter
        stand for at least 30 minutes. Batter can even be covered and refrigerated overnight until ready to use.

        Heat skillet over medium heat. Add enough butter to thinly cover pan. Ladle the batter 1/3 cup at a time. Cook pancakes until done and
        slightly browned on each side. Repeat, cooking pancakes in batches adding butter to pan as needed.
